### Pubertal Timing and Emotion in the ABCD Study
> *Role*. first-author

> *Co-authors*. jennifer a. silvers 

> *Status*.</br> 
---> waiting for raw data 

> *Summary*. using the [pubertal-age-gap](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.13.22275069v1) to derive pubertal timing in the [ABCD study](https://abcdstudy.org/) and examine its association with emotional processing in the brain and emotional well-being.

> *Status*. </br>
---> manuscript is in-progress. we are assaying the pubertal hormones.</br>
---> presented preliminary findings at the [flux society annual congress](https://fluxsociety.org/2022-paris/) in paris, france in the summer of 2022.

> *Summary*. examining how pubertal timing and tempo derived from both self-report and hormonal measures of puberty predict structural brain development in a cohort of 174 adolescents.

---> will be collected in the [tag study](https://uodsnlab.com/our-research/project-one-ry55p) </br>
---> drafting manuscript

> *Summary*. created a measure to assess perceptions of puberty to derive a more social measure of pubertal development, focusing on the appraisal component. will work towards the proof of concept.

### Pathways in Adolescence</br>
