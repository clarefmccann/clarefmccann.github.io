### Pubertal Timing and Emotion in the ABCD Study
> *Role*. first-author

> *Co-authors*. jennifer a. silvers 

> *Status*.</br> 
---> writing analysis script 

> *Summary*. using the [pubertal-age-gap](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.13.22275069v1) to derive pubertal timing in the [ABCD study](https://abcdstudy.org/) and examine its association with emotional processing in the brain and emotional well-being.

### Part 2: A Researcher's Guide to the Longitudinal Measurement and Modeling of Puberty in the ABCD Study
> *Role*. first-author

> *Co-authors*. theresa w. cheng, lucía magis-weinberg, victora guazzelli williamson, niamh macsweeney, cecile d. ladouceur, sarah l. wittle, megan m. merting, kristina a. uban, michelle l. byrne, marjolein e.a. barendse, elizabeth a. shirtcliff, megan peterson, katie bottenham, jennifer h. pfeifer, jennifer a. silvers  

> *Status*. </br>
---> forming working groups and establishing a project timeline 
---> structuring outline 

> *Summary*. will be writing a follow-up piece on ["a researcher's guide to the measurement and modeling of puberty in the ABCD study at baseline"](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34025573/) but focusing on the longitudinal nature of the dataset.

### Puberty and Structural Brain Development: It's About Time</br>
> *Role*. first-author</br>

> *Co-authors*. kathryn l. mills, marjolein e.a. barendse, jennifer h. pfeifer

> *Status*. </br>
---> manuscript is in-progress. we are assaying the pubertal hormones.</br>
---> presented preliminary findings at the [flux society annual congress](https://fluxsociety.org/2022-paris/) in paris, france in the summer of 2022.

> *Summary*. examining how pubertal timing and tempo derived from both self-report and hormonal measures of puberty predict structural brain development in a cohort of 174 adolescents.

### Pubertal Perceptions in Adolescence - Focus Groups</br>
> *Role*. co-primary investigator</br>

> *Co-primary investigator*. jennifer a. silvers

> *Status*. </br>
---> beginning data collection.

> *Summary*. conducting focus groups to understand further how adolescents feel about puberty and what they want to know. we will also use the data collected to inform more inclusive measures of puberty.

### Gender Neutral Puberty Perception Measure</br>
> *Role*. first-author / co-creator

> *Co-creators*. jennifer a. silvers, elizabeth a. shirtcliff, jennifer h. pfeifer

> *Status*.</br>
---> will be collected in the [tag study](https://uodsnlab.com/our-research/project-one-ry55p) </br>
---> active data collection in a larger college-aged sample to link perceptions of puberty to later life outcomes and early life experience.

> *Summary*. created a measure to assess perceptions of puberty to derive a more social measure of pubertal development, focusing on the appraisal component. will work towards the proof of concept.

### Pathways in Adolescence</br>
> *Role*. first-author</br>

> *Co-authors*. joão guassi moreira, maya o'kelly, emilia novia, jennifer a. silvers

> *Status*.</br>
---> data collection is underway.</br>
---> recruiting ~22 more 13-17-year-olds and their caregivers in the LA area to come to UCLA for a paid research study (1.5 hours). **contact me if you are interested or know someone that may be!**

> *Summary*. exploring cognitive reappraisal, impulse inhibition, and risk-taking across adolescence.

## from Post-Bac

### Comparing the Multivariate Relationships of Conceptual Adversity Models and Structural Brain Development in Adolescent Girls*.</br>
> *Role*. fourth-author w/ [ann-marie barrett](https://uodsnlab.com/team/annmariebarrett) as first-author</br

> *Co-authors*. theresa w. cheng, jessica flannery, kathryn l. mills, robert chavez, phil fisher, jennifer h. pfeifer

> *Status*. under review.

> *Summary*. determining whether the dimensional or cumulative risk model of adversity better predicts cortical thinning in frontoparietal and frontotemporal networks and volumetric changes in subcortical regions throughout adolescence.
