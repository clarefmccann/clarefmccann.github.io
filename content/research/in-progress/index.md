## Puberty and Structural Brain Development: It's About Time</br>

## Puberty Perception Measure</br>
- *Role*. first-author / creator
- *Status*. under irb review, will be piloted in the [tag study](https://uodsnlab.com/our-research/project-one-ry55p) and then implemented in a larger college-aged sample to link perceptions of puberty to later life outcomes and early life experience.
- *Summary*. created a measure to assess perceptions of puberty to derive a more social measure of pubertal development focusing on the appraisal component. will work towards proof of concept.

## Pathways in Adolescence</br>
- *Role*. first-author</br>
- *Status*. data collection underway. recruiting ~22 more 13-17 year olds and their caregivers in LA area to come to UCLA for a paid research study (1.5 hours). contact me if interested or know someone that may be!
- *Summary*. exploring cognitive reappraisal, impulse inhibition and risk-taking across adolescence.

## Comparing the Multivariate Relationships of Conceptual Adversity Models and Structural Brain Development in Adolescent Girls*.</br>
- *Role*. fourth-author w/ [ann-marie barrett](https://uodsnlab.com/team/annmariebarrett) as first-author</br>
- *Status*. under review.
- *Summary*. determining whether the dimensional or cumulative risk model of adversity better predicts cortical thinning in frontoparietal and frontotemporal networks and volumeteric changes in subcortical regions throughout adolescence.

## Self-perceived scholastic competence and trait mindfulness during school transitions in adolescent girls.</br>
- *Role*. first-author
- *Status*. accepted for publication to [collabra: psychology](https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra). yay!
- *Summary*. undergraduate honors thesis exploring prior levels of trait mindfulness prediting later on levels of self-perceived scholastic competence in adolescent girls.
