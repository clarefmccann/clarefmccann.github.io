### Puberty and Structural Brain Development: It's About Time</br>
> *Role*. first-author</br>

> *Co-authors*. kathryn l. mills, marjolein e.a. barendse, jennifer h. pfeifer

> *Status*. </br>
---> manuscript is in-progress. we are assaying the pubertal hormones.</br>
---> presented preliminary findings at the [flux society annual congress](https://fluxsociety.org/2022-paris/) in paris, france in the summer of 2022.

> *Summary*. examining how pubertal timing and tempo derived from both self-report and hormonal measures of puberty predict structural brain development in a cohort of 174 adolescents.

### Pubertal Perceptions in Adolescence</br>
> *Role*. co-primary investigator</br>

> *Co-primary investigator*. jennifer a. silvers

> *Status*. under IRB review.

> *Summary*. conducting focus groups to understand further how adolescents feel about puberty and what they want to know. we will also use the data collected to inform more inclusive measures of puberty.

### Puberty Perception Measure</br>
> *Role*. first-author / co-creator

> *Co-creators*. jennifer a. silvers, elizabeth a. shirtcliff, jennifer h. pfeifer

> *Status*.</br>
---> under IRB review. </br>
---> will be piloted in the [tag study](https://uodsnlab.com/our-research/project-one-ry55p) </br>
---> will be implemented in a larger college-aged sample to link perceptions of puberty to later life outcomes and early life experience.

> *Summary*. created a measure to assess perceptions of puberty to derive a more social measure of pubertal development, focusing on the appraisal component. will work towards the proof of concept.

### Pathways in Adolescence</br>
> *Role*. first-author</br>

> *Co-authors*. joÃ£o guassi moreira, maya o'kelly, emilia novia, jennifer a. silvers

> *Status*.</br>
---> data collection is underway.</br>
---> recruiting ~22 more 13-17-year-olds and their caregivers in the LA area to come to UCLA for a paid research study (1.5 hours). **contact me if you are interested or know someone that may be!**

> *Summary*. exploring cognitive reappraisal, impulse inhibition, and risk-taking across adolescence.

### Comparing the Multivariate Relationships of Conceptual Adversity Models and Structural Brain Development in Adolescent Girls*.</br>
> *Role*. fourth-author w/ [ann-marie barrett](https://uodsnlab.com/team/annmariebarrett) as first-author</br

> *Co-authors*. theresa w. cheng, jessica flannery, kathryn l. mills, robert chavez, phil fisher, jennifer h. pfeifer

> *Status*. under review.

> *Summary*. determining whether the dimensional or cumulative risk model of adversity better predicts cortical thinning in frontoparietal and frontotemporal networks and volumetric changes in subcortical regions throughout adolescence.

## from Undergrad

### Self-perceived scholastic competence and trait mindfulness during school transitions in adolescent girls.</br>
> *Role*. first-author

> *Co-authors*. theresa w. cheng, arian mobasser, jennifer h. pfeifer, kathryn l. mills

> *Status*. accepted for publication to [collabra: psychology](https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra). yay!

> *Summary*. undergraduate honors thesis exploring prior levels of trait mindfulness predicting later on levels of self-perceived scholastic competence in adolescent girls.
