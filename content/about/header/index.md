Hi, welcome to my website! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in Developmental Psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles. I work under the mentorship of Dr. Jennifer Silvers in the [Social Affective Neuroscience and Development lab](https://silverslab.psych.ucla.edu/). My research focuses on **adolescent brain and behavior development**. More specifically, I'm interested in disentangling the *bio-psycho-social intersection* of adolescent development and later life outcomes. Read more about my research interests in [the research section of my site](https://clarefmccann.rbind.io/research/).

I also enjoy staring at code for too long, pretending to like running, and reading pages of a book only to realize I have yet to learn what is going on in the plot.
